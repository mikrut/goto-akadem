# TorChat
A simple messaging application for Android working over Tor network to transfer data anonymously and securely.
Provides an ability of P2P connections between users by using Tor Hidden Services (*.onion addresses).
It's security was not tested and as for now it's really pretty poor.

[Orbot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android) is required to use the full functionality of this app.
We also use the [NetCipher](https://github.com/guardianproject/NetCipher) library developed by some people from a [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/).

The **server part** for this project can be found here: https://github.com/Vendin/Messenger-BackEnd
